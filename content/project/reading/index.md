summary: Here are some of my reflections and thoughts on these books.
abstract: I love reading! Over time, Iâ€™ve realized that some books merit multiple readings, while others can be skipped. What follows are my highly subjective impressions of several books. If you havenâ€™t read it before, I suggest skipping the review. But if you have, I invite you to see whether you agree or disagree ðŸ¤£.
