      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Dr. Zhang Ziwen received his PhD in Science from the Department of Astronomy at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where he studied from September 2018 to November 2024. From April 2023 to April 2024, he participated in a joint PhD training program at CEA Paris-Saclay. Since December 2024, he has been working as a postdoctoral researcher at USTC.

His research focuses on galaxy formation and evolution, the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos, the co-evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies, as well as weak gravitational lensing.
